# Ecological_Genomics_23

Welcome! This is my repo for Ecological Genomics! I have three separate folders within this repo that are titled: "scripts," "results," and "data."

"scripts" will have scripts both used in R and bash.

"results" will have results generated in class. There is another folder labeled "Homework1" that contains all of the results generated for the first homework assignment. I did this so I did not rewrite over class data and I can keep track of which files was for what activity. I focused on an eigenvalue of 2 (K=3) in the first homework assignment so the results in that folder reflects that. For class, we focused on an eigenvalue of 1 (K=2).

"data" will have figures I generated in R that I will use in write ups.

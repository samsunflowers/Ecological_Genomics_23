<id='id-section1'/>

- We obtained background on the Red spruce study system and the experimental design of the exome capture data. 
- Visualized and interpreted Illumina data quality: what is a FastQ file? 
- Trimmed the reads based on base quality scores in preparation for mapping to the reference genome. 
- fastq files are stored in this path: '/netfiles/ecogen/PopulationGenomics/fastq/red_spruce'

- After discussing the Fast QC results, we saw good quality sequence dta for most of the read length. The inital 5 bp or so had more variable base frequencies and the very end of the reads had slightly lower Q-scores.
- Based on this, we set up an analysis to trim the reads using the 'fastp' program.
- We ran the bas script 'fastp.sh' for this.
- We looked at the html files produced by 'fastp' and compared pre- and post-trimming --things looked good!

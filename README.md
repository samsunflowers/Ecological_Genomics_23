# Ecological_Genomics_23

Welcome! This is my repo for Ecological Genomics! I have three separate folders within this repo that are titled: "scripts," "results," and "data."

"scripts" will have scripts both used in R and bash.

"results" will have results generated in class.

"data" will have figures I generated in R that I will use in write ups.
